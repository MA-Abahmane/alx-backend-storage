Write a Python script that provides some stats about Nginx logs stored in
 MongoDB:
    * Database: logs
    * Collection: nginx
    * Display (same as the example):
    * first line: x logs where x is the number of documents in this collection
    * second line: Methods:
    * 5 lines with the number of documents with the method = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"] in this order (see example below - warning: itâ€™s a tabulation before each line)
    * one line with the number of documents with:
    * method=GET
    * path=/status
